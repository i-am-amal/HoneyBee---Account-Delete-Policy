Delete Account Privacy Policy

* Account Deletion Process
At HoneyBee, we understand that users may choose to delete their accounts or request the deletion of specific data for various reasons. While we do not provide an option within the app interface to delete your account or specific data directly, users who wish to delete their HoneyBee accounts or request the deletion of specific data can do so by following a simple process:

Contact Us: Users must send an email to amalflutterprojects@gmail.com indicating their desire to delete their HoneyBee account or specify the data they wish to be deleted.

Confirmation: Upon receiving the account deletion or data deletion request, we will send a confirmation email to the user's registered email address within 24 hours. This email will confirm the request and outline the steps to proceed with the account deletion or data deletion process.

Verification: For security purposes, we may require users to verify their identity to ensure that the account deletion request or data deletion request is legitimate. This may involve providing certain account details or other identifying information.

Processing Time: Once the user's identity is verified, we will initiate the account deletion or data deletion process. Please note that account deletion requests or data deletion requests may take up to 4 weeks to process from the date of receipt of the initial request email. During this time, users may continue to access their HoneyBee accounts and use the app as usual.

Confirmation of Deletion: Upon successful deletion of the user's account or specific data, we will send a final confirmation email to the user's registered email address. This email will confirm that the account or specified data has been permanently deleted from our system.
